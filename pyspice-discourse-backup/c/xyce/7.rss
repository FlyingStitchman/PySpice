            <p>Hi, I have installed Xyce, NGSpice and PySpice and everything is almost working… except, when I run on iPython (actually Anaconda Spyder) then I stumbled into a cdef problem on duplidate definition of ngcomplex. I can see on github some discussion, but not clear to me how to move forward on it. No mater, I have Xyce. But then I was stumbling at the start [again]. The documentation says to set an attribute</p>
<p>PySpice.Spice.Xyce.Server.XyceServer.XYCE_COMMAND = “C:\Program Files\Xyce 7.1 OPENSOURCE\bin\Xyce.exe”</p>
<p>But where do I type that? It seems to be an attribute of a class or something?? So then I try<br>
… = simulator(xyce_command=r"C:\Program Files\Xyce 7.1 OPENSOURCE\bin\Xyce.exe", simulator=‘xyce-serial’,…)</p>
<p>and that one dies with file not found, although it is the correct command to launch Xyce.</p>
<p>What finally worked (yeh!) was to edit by hand the PySpice source code and find where XyceCommand was defined and wow. I’m amazed. Works perfectly <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>But was there a cleaner way that I could have done this?</p>
<p>Thanks so much for  putting this product together. I’m excited to check it out further.</p>
